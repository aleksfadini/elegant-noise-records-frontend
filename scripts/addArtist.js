    description: "Emerson Bergenfield is a Los Angeles-based vocalist and composer with roots in opera and the jazz tradition. Bergenfield began studying opera her freshman year of high school, where she attended the Las Vegas Academy of the Arts, and played in the school's various choir and jazz ensembles. Under the instruction of Dr. Josiah Boornazian at the University of Utah, Bergenfield deepened her connection and love for jazz and knew it was an art form that she would forever pursue. Now under the direction of Shigemi Matsumoto at California State University Northridge, Bergenfield continues to hone her skills as a classically trained vocalist and aims to combine her technique with her knowledge and love for jazz. Bergenfield's main influences stem from Maria Callas and Cecilia Bartoli, to Sarah Vaughan and Stan Getz. Her style of production is influenced by her love for the trip-hop genre, which includes bands like Massive Attack and Portishead. Emersonâ€™s debut record titled Something In Return is a collection of songs written and arranged by her and her colleagues in the Utah jazz scene and is a reflection of her growth as an artist while meshing her love for all of her favorite styles of music.",
